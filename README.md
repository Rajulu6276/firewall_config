# ðŸ”’ Task 4: Setup and Use a Firewall (Windows 11)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows 11 to block or allow traffic on specific ports. This task demonstrates the ability to manage firewall settings and understand how network traffic is filtered.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Windows 11
- Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security
- Command Prompt / PowerShell
- Telnet Client
- OpenSSH Server

---

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

### 1. View Existing Rules
- Opened *Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security*
- Viewed current *Inbound* and *Outbound* rules
- Captured a screenshot for documentation

---

### 2. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
- Created a new *Inbound Rule* to block TCP traffic on port 23
- Rule Name: Block Telnet Port 23
- Applied to all profiles
- Verified the block using:

cmd
dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
telnet localhost 23


- *Expected Output:*  
  Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed

---

### 3. Allow Inbound Traffic on Port 22 (SSH)
- Enabled *OpenSSH Server* using:

powershell
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server
Start-Service sshd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'


- Allowed port 22 through the firewall:

cmd
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow SSH" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=22


- Tested connection using:

cmd
ssh localhost


- *Expected Output:* SSH login prompt

---

### 4. Restore Original Firewall State
- Removed the test block rule for Telnet via:

cmd
netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Block Telnet Port 23"

## ðŸ“¸ Screenshots
- [x] Existing firewall rules
- [x] Rule creation steps
- [x] Telnet test failure
- [x] SSH success message

*(Upload these in the repo under screenshots/ folder)*

---

## ðŸ“˜ Key Concepts
- Firewalls control traffic using port/protocol-based rules.
- Port 23 is commonly blocked due to insecure Telnet protocol.
- Port 22 (SSH) is allowed for secure remote access.
- Windows Firewall supports both GUI and CLI management.

---

## âœ… Outcome
Successfully demonstrated basic firewall configuration on Windows 11:
- Blocked and tested Telnet (Port 23)
- Allowed and tested SSH (Port 22)
- Understood inbound/outbound rule behavior
